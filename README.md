# Pokemon Emerald: Bootleg Edition
Pokemon Emerald visual engine written in Java with JavaFX. Not very organized, made more as a fun attempt. Would love to return when I have a more solid idea with organizing more complex projects like this, especially since JavaFX is not the friendliest library for things necessary for a more accurate engine (GIF Manipulation, image analysis). May try to do something similar in a higher-level library before attempting this again, perhaps Unity?
